Same as test3, but using Opal method for energy sharing after ionization event.
This is considerably slower than using equal or zero energy sharing.
The sharing method is selected for each ionization even in the xsec file using
0 (zero) 1 (equal) 2 (Opal). This integer value is placed after the ionization
potential.
