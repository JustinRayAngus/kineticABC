In order to compile executable for test do the following:

First  - "source setHDF5HOME" in order to set home directories to stuff
Second - "mkdir thisbuild" "cd thisbuild" "cmake ../src/" "make"
Third  - copy over/create input (input.json) and xsection file
Fourth - run executable: "./tdb"

Note that I had to change some of the include and link directories in 
CMakeLists.txt since the version is out of date and gmock and gtest 
have been combined 

See pg 79-80 of Modern C++ Programming with Test-Driven Development.
I may not have json installed with correct version of gcc (4.7 vs 4.9).
I also may not have the appropriate link formed.

"cd $JSONCPP_HOME/libs/linux-gcc-4.7.4/"
"ln -s libjson_linux-gcc-4.9.3_libmt.a libjson_linux-gcc.4.9.3.a"

I installed hdf5 with cxx wrapper by unzipping the source obtained 
from www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtainsrc.html and following the 
instructions in hdf5-1.8.16/release_docs/INSTALL
1) unzip 
2) cd hdf5-1.8.16
3) ./configure --enable-cxx
4) make
5) make check
6) make install
7) make check-install
