In order to compile executable for test do the following:

First, "source source_me" in order to set home directories to stuff
Second, "mkdir thisbuild" "cd thisbuild" "cmake .." "make", "./test"

Note that I had to change some of the include and link directories in CMakeLists.txt since the version is out of date and gmock and gtest have been combined 

See pg 79-80 of Modern C++ Programming with Test-Driven Development.
I may not have json installed with correct version of gcc (4.7 vs 4.9).
I also may not have the appropriate link formed.

"cd $JSONCPP_HOME/libs/linux-gcc-4.7.4/"
"ln -s libjson_linux-gcc-4.9.3_libmt.a libjson_linux-gcc.4.9.3.a"
