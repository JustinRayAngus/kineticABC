1) Linking JSONCPP library

I had issues with getting the appropriate library link for json when 
installing with scons. I found how to install with Cmake and that worked better.

Note that link should be location where libjsoncpp.a is located when using Cmake
installed version and should be where json_linu-gcc-4.7.4 is located when using 
scons installed version

2) using hdf5cpp

I had to configure hdf5 with --enable-cxx. Also, there is some issue with passing
H5std_strings to the wrapper functions. So I define a regular string, then pass
the string as c characters by using "string.c_str()", which the functions accept
just fine
