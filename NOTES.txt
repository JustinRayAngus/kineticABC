1) Linking JSONCPP library

I had issues with getting the appropriate library link for json when 
installing with scons. I found how to install with Cmake and that worked better.

Note that link should be location where libjsoncpp.a is located when using Cmake
installed version and should be where json_linu-gcc-4.7.4 is located when using 
scons installed version
